# Requirements: Feature-First Architecture Refactoring

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for restructuring the or3-chat codebase from a flat Nuxt structure to a feature-first architecture. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience by co-locating related code within feature modules while preserving all Nuxt framework conventions and auto-import capabilities.

**Scope**: Complete reorganization of the application source code (`app/` directory) into `core/`, `shared/`, and `features/` directories, with updates to Nuxt and TypeScript configurations to maintain seamless auto-imports and type checking.

**Goals**:

-   Improve code discoverability and maintainability through feature-based organization
-   Preserve all existing functionality without regression
-   Maintain Nuxt's auto-import capabilities for components, composables, and utilities
-   Enable better separation of concerns between infrastructure, shared utilities, and feature-specific code
-   Facilitate easier testing through co-located test files

## Requirements

### 1. Structural Organization

#### 1.1 Core Infrastructure Layer

**User Story**: As a developer, I want cross-cutting infrastructure code organized in a dedicated `core/` directory, so that I can easily locate and maintain framework-level functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all hook engine code SHALL be located in `app/core/hooks/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all theme-related infrastructure SHALL be located in `app/core/theme/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all authentication and OpenRouter integration code SHALL be located in `app/core/auth/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all search infrastructure (Orama) SHALL be located in `app/core/search/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN each core module SHALL export a public API via an `index.ts` barrel file
-   WHEN a developer imports from core, THEN they SHALL use the `@core/*` alias (e.g., `@core/hooks`)

#### 1.2 Shared Utilities Layer

**User Story**: As a developer, I want reusable, feature-agnostic components and utilities in a dedicated `shared/` directory, so that I can avoid duplication and maintain consistency across features.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all generic UI components (FatalErrorBoundary, PageShell, ResizableSidebarLayout, RetroGlassBtn) SHALL be located in `app/shared/components/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all generic composables (useObservedElementSize, usePreviewCache, useStreamAccumulator) SHALL be located in `app/shared/composables/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all generic utilities (errors, hash, capability-guards, file helpers) SHALL be located in `app/shared/utils/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all global TypeScript type definitions SHALL be located in `app/shared/types/`
-   WHEN a developer imports from shared, THEN they SHALL use the `@shared/*` alias (e.g., `@shared/components/PageShell.vue`)

#### 1.3 Feature Modules

**User Story**: As a developer, I want feature-specific code co-located within feature directories, so that I can understand and modify a feature without navigating across the entire codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN the following feature directories SHALL exist: `chat/`, `documents/`, `editor/`, `dashboard/`, `sidebar/`, `images/`, `threads/`, `projects/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN each feature directory SHALL contain `components/`, `composables/`, and `utils/` subdirectories as needed
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN chat-specific code (ChatContainer, useAi, openrouterStream, etc.) SHALL be located in `app/features/chat/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN document-specific code SHALL be located in `app/features/documents/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN editor-specific code (PromptEditor, TiptapExtension, etc.) SHALL be located in `app/features/editor/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN dashboard-specific code (Dashboard.vue, ThemePage.vue, WorkspaceBackupApp.vue) SHALL be located in `app/features/dashboard/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN sidebar-specific code SHALL be located in `app/features/sidebar/`
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN image gallery code SHALL be located in `app/features/images/`
-   WHEN a developer imports from features, THEN they SHALL use the `@features/*` alias (e.g., `@features/chat/composables/useAi`)

#### 1.4 Database Layer Isolation

**User Story**: As a developer, I want database access code isolated in a dedicated `db/` directory, so that data layer concerns are separated from application logic.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN the database layer SHALL export a public API via `db/index.ts`
-   WHEN a developer imports from the database layer, THEN they SHALL use the `@db/*` alias (e.g., `@db/threads`)

#### 1.5 Nuxt Standard Directories Preserved

**User Story**: As a developer, I want Nuxt's standard directories (`pages/`, `plugins/`, `layouts/`, `middleware/`) to remain in their conventional locations, so that Nuxt's auto-discovery and routing continue to work without modification.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all route files SHALL remain in `app/pages/` with unchanged paths
-   WHEN the refactoring is complete, THEN all Nuxt plugin entry files SHALL remain in `app/plugins/`

### NFR-2: Consistency

The refactored codebase SHALL follow consistent patterns for:

-   Directory structure within features
-   Import path conventions
-   Barrel export patterns
-   Test file organization

### NFR-3: Compatibility

The refactored codebase SHALL maintain compatibility with:

-   Nuxt 4.x framework conventions
-   TypeScript 5.x type system
-   Vitest testing framework

### NFR-4: Developer Experience

The refactored codebase SHALL maintain or improve developer experience:

-   Auto-imports SHALL continue to work seamlessly
-   IDE autocomplete SHALL work correctly with new paths
