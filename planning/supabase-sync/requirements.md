## Introduction

This document defines the first draft requirements for a lightweight Supabase sync engine plugin. The plugin attaches to the existing hook system, keeps client-side stores in lockstep with Supabase tables, and operates invisibly so end users experience consistent data without manual refresh. Scope covers bidirectional sync for all app tables currently mapped in the local store, minimal conflict handling, and graceful degradation when the network is unavailable. The design favors small, composable pieces and avoids bespoke infrastructure.

## Requirements

### 1. Zero-Config Plugin Registration

User Story: As a signed-in user, I want the sync engine to start automatically, so that my data stays up to date without extra steps.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.1 WHEN the Nuxt app bootstraps on the client THEN the plugin SHALL register itself via the existing hook registry without requiring manual imports in pages or components.
1.2 WHEN a Supabase session is present THEN the plugin SHALL initialize the sync engine within 1000ms.
1.3 IF the user signs out THEN the plugin SHALL tear down all subscriptions and timers within 500ms.

### 2. Table-Agnostic Subscription Coverage

User Story: As a developer, I want the sync engine to cover all data models we expose locally, so that no manual sync gaps exist.

Acceptance Criteria:
2.1 The plugin SHALL read a single config object that lists every Supabase table and its local store adapter.
2.2 WHEN the plugin starts THEN it SHALL subscribe to realtime changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for each table in the config.
2.3 IF a table is added to the config THEN the plugin SHALL begin syncing it without code changes elsewhere.

### 3. Local Store Application

User Story: As an end user, I want remote updates to appear quickly, so that my UI reflects current data.

Acceptance Criteria:
3.1 WHEN a realtime payload arrives THEN the plugin SHALL map it through a hook-provided transformer and write the result to the matching local store within 200ms.
3.2 IF the transformer throws THEN the plugin SHALL emit a `sync:error` hook event and skip the faulty payload instead of crashing.
3.3 WHEN a DELETE event is received THEN the plugin SHALL remove the entity from the local store if it exists.

### 4. Outbound Change Propagation

User Story: As a contributor, I want my local mutations to reach Supabase automatically, so that collaboration stays in sync.

Acceptance Criteria:
4.1 WHEN local CRUD hooks fire (`db:*:mutated`) THEN the plugin SHALL enqueue diff payloads for Supabase within 50ms.
4.2 The plugin SHALL batch outbound writes per table with a maximum 250ms delay to avoid excessive network calls.
4.3 IF a Supabase write fails THEN the plugin SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts and surface a non-fatal `sync:retry` hook event.

### 5. Offline and Resilience Handling

User Story: As an offline user, I want changes buffered until connectivity returns, so that my work is not lost.

Acceptance Criteria:
5.1 IF the network is unreachable THEN the plugin SHALL queue outbound diffs in IndexedDB (or existing persistence) until connectivity is restored.
5.2 WHEN connectivity resumes THEN the plugin SHALL flush the queue in arrival order.
5.3 IF the queue exceeds 5MB THEN the plugin SHALL drop the oldest entries and emit a `sync:queue:overflow` warning hook.

### 6. Transparency and Performance

User Story: As a product owner, I want the sync engine to stay unobtrusive, so that it has no visible footprint.

Acceptance Criteria:
6.1 The plugin SHALL execute entirely in the background without rendering UI components or requiring user input.
6.2 Sync operations SHALL keep CPU usage under 5% p95 during idle listening.
6.3 The plugin SHALL expose metrics via hooks (`sync:stats`) for debugging but SHALL not log to the console in production mode.

### 7. Pluggable Sync Providers

User Story: As a maintainer, I want to swap Supabase for another backend with minimal code changes, so that the sync engine stays future-proof.

Acceptance Criteria:
7.1 The plugin SHALL define a provider interface that encapsulates realtime subscription and CRUD operations, with Supabase implemented as the default provider.
7.2 IF a new provider implementation conforms to the interface THEN wiring it in SHALL only require updating the plugin options/provider factory with no edits to adapters or hook wiring.
7.3 Provider-specific configuration (e.g., API keys, endpoints) SHALL be passed through a single options object without altering core engine logic.

## Non-functional Requirements

-   Compatibility: Works with existing Nuxt 3 setup, Supabase JS client, and hook infrastructure documented in `docs/core-hook-map.md`.
-   Simplicity: Single lightweight plugin file under `app/plugins`, relying on hook callbacks instead of new services.
-   Testability: Unit tests cover transformers, queue flush logic, and error surfaces; integration tests validate hook wiring with a mocked Supabase client.
-   Privacy: Uses Supabase authenticated sessions only; does not transmit extra telemetry.
