# Mobile Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

-   Target components: `app/components/DocumentationShell.vue` and `app/components/ui/HelpChat.vue`
-   Goal: deliver a comfortable mobile experience by adapting layouts, navigation, and interactions for ≤768px viewports while preserving existing desktop behavior.
-   Constraint: desktop layouts (>768px) SHALL remain visually and functionally identical to the current implementation.

## Requirements

1. Mobile Documentation Layout

-   User Story: As a mobile reader, I want the documentation view to prioritize the article content, so that I can read without the sidebar crowding the screen.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the viewport width is ≤768px THEN the sidebar navigation SHALL be hidden by default and replaced with a discoverable toggle control.
    -   WHEN the viewport width exceeds 768px THEN the sidebar navigation SHALL remain visible as it is today.
    -   WHEN the navigation toggle is activated on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL slide in as an overlay that can be dismissed via close control, outside tap, or Escape key.

2. Sidebar Navigation Interaction

-   User Story: As a mobile reader, I want intuitive navigation controls, so that I can jump between docs quickly without losing context.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the sidebar overlay is open on mobile THEN background scrolling SHALL be prevented until the sidebar is closed.
    -   WHEN a navigation link is tapped on mobile THEN the sidebar overlay SHALL close and focus SHALL return to the main content area.
    -   WHEN the sidebar toggle is visible THEN it SHALL be keyboard accessible with appropriate `aria` attributes describing its expanded state.

3. Help Chat Mobile Experience

-   User Story: As a mobile user, I want the help chat to use the full screen, so that I can read and compose messages comfortably.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the viewport width is ≤768px AND the help chat is expanded THEN it SHALL occupy 100% of the viewport width and height.
    -   WHEN the viewport width is ≤768px AND the help chat is collapsed THEN the launcher button SHALL remain reachable without overlapping critical UI.
    -   WHEN the viewport width exceeds 768px THEN the existing desktop sizing behavior SHALL remain unchanged.

4. Responsiveness & Visual Hierarchy

-   User Story: As a mobile reader, I want clean spacing and readable typography, so that I can scan content without zooming.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN viewing on ≤768px THEN the documentation header, search bar, and action buttons SHALL stack vertically with adequate spacing (≥8px gap).
    -   WHEN the documentation content renders on mobile THEN typography, paddings, and scroll regions SHALL follow a mobile-friendly scale (e.g., base font ≥16px, comfortable line heights).
    -   WHEN the help chat streams responses on mobile THEN text blocks SHALL wrap correctly without horizontal scrolling.

5. Performance & Accessibility

-   User Story: As a developer, I want the mobile enhancements to be performant and accessible, so that all users benefit without regressions.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the mobile sidebar opens THEN animations SHALL complete within 200ms without jank on mid-range devices.
    -   WHEN assistive technologies inspect the new controls THEN all interactive elements SHALL expose accurate labels, roles, and states.
    -   WHEN running Lighthouse mobile audits THEN the interaction improvements SHALL not introduce new accessibility or performance regressions compared to baseline.

6. Desktop Parity

-   User Story: As a desktop user, I want the interface to stay exactly as it is today, so that my navigation muscle memory still works.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the viewport width exceeds 768px THEN the sidebar SHALL remain permanently visible with no additional toggles or overlays.
    -   WHEN the viewport width exceeds 768px THEN the documentation header layout SHALL match the existing desktop design with unchanged spacing.
    -   WHEN the viewport width exceeds 768px THEN the help chat launcher and expanded panel sizing SHALL remain identical to the current desktop behavior.
