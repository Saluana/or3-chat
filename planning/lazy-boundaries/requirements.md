# Lazy Boundary Requirements

## Introduction

-   Scope: defer heavy editor, search, and backup tooling bundles behind UI-driven lazy boundaries.
-   Goal: cut initial bundle size and hydration time by loading TipTap, Orama, streamsaver, dexie-export-import, and Turndown only after the user requests the feature.
-   Constraint: preserve existing functionality, autosave semantics, and accessibility behaviors once features mount.

## Requirements

1. Lazy Document Editor Host

-   User Story: As a document author, I want the rich-text editor to load only when I open a document, so that the main application starts faster.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the documents area renders without an active editor session THEN the network waterfall SHALL show no requests for `@tiptap/*` assets.
    -   WHEN the user opens a document THEN the app SHALL render `<LazyEditorHost>` that dynamically imports the editor implementation before mounting it.
    -   WHEN the dynamic import fails (offline/reload) THEN the UI SHALL display an inline error with a retry control without crashing the page.

2. Lazy Editor Extension Registry

-   User Story: As a plugin author, I want editor extensions to load on demand, so that optional functionality does not bloat the core bundle.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN a plugin registers TipTap extensions THEN the registry SHALL accept factories that return dynamic imports resolved only after `<LazyEditorHost>` requests them.
    -   WHEN the editor first instantiates THEN the extension loader SHALL await all required dynamic imports before creating the TipTap instance.
    -   WHEN an extension import throws THEN the loader SHALL log the failure, skip that extension, and continue initializing the editor with remaining modules.

3. Lazy Search Panel

-   User Story: As a documentation reader, I want the search UI to load only when I open it, so that documentation pages remain lightweight.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN documentation routes render without the search panel opened THEN no `@orama/orama` code SHALL be present in the initial hydration chunk.
    -   WHEN the user focuses or expands the search input THEN the UI SHALL render `<LazySearchPanel>` which lazy-loads panel markup and search logic.
    -   WHEN the panel loads THEN previously indexed search data SHALL remain accessible without requiring a full re-index.

4. Dynamic Search Worker Initialization

-   User Story: As a performance-focused developer, I want Orama’s optional worker to spin up only during indexing, so that idle visits do not spawn Web Workers.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN documentation metadata indexing begins THEN the search module SHALL dynamically import the worker entry and create it only once per tab.
    -   WHEN search is idle or disabled THEN no worker thread SHALL be active.
    -   WHEN the worker fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL fall back to in-thread indexing with an explicit telemetry event.

5. Lazy Export/Import Dependencies

-   User Story: As a workspace maintainer, I want backup/export toolchains to load only when I click export or import, so that regular chat use remains fast.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN the export or import buttons are visible but untouched THEN the bundle analyzer SHALL show no `streamsaver`, `dexie-export-import`, or `turndown` code in the primary chunk.
    -   WHEN the user clicks export THEN the handler SHALL `await` dynamic imports before starting the file stream and show a loading affordance if the import takes >150 ms.
    -   WHEN the user selects an import file THEN the handler SHALL lazy-load dependencies, detect the format, and surface progress just as the current implementation does.

6. Performance & Telemetry Verification

-   User Story: As a release engineer, I want proof that lazy boundaries reduce bundle cost without regressions, so that I can ship confidently.
-   Acceptance Criteria:
    -   WHEN running `bunx nuxt build --analyze` before and after the change THEN the vendor chunk size SHALL drop by at least 20% (~>200 KB) with no new warnings.
    -   WHEN runtime lazy imports resolve THEN the app SHALL emit a `lazy-boundary:loaded` debug event (console or Analytics) containing the boundary id and load duration.
    -   WHEN lazy loading metrics indicate repeated failures (>5% of sessions) THEN the system SHALL surface an alert in existing error reporting channels.
