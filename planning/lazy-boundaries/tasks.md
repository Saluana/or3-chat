# Lazy Boundary Tasks

## 1. Establish Lazy Boundary Infrastructure

-   [x] Implement `useLazyBoundaries` composable with state tracking, memoized loaders, and telemetry emission (Requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
-   [x] Add unit tests covering success, failure, and reset flows for the composable (Requirements: 6)

## 2. Lazy Document Editor Host

-   [x] Create `<LazyEditorHost>` component using `defineAsyncComponent` with skeleton and retry UI (Requirements: 1)
-   [x] Extract core editor implementation to `DocumentEditorRoot` (or similar) returns factory for Lazy host (Requirements: 1)
-   [x] Update document routes to swap direct `<DocumentEditor>` usage with `<LazyEditorHost>` (Requirements: 1)

## 3. Lazy TipTap Extension Loading

-   [ ] Extend plugin APIs to accept dynamic extension factories and update registries to await them (Requirements: 2)
-   [ ] Update built-in extensions to register via lazy factories and ensure failure skips are logged (Requirements: 2)
-   [ ] Write unit tests validating extension loader behavior for success, partial failure, and caching (Requirements: 2)

## 4. Lazy Documentation Search Panel

-   [ ] Implement `<LazySearchPanel>` that loads UI and Orama runtime on focus/expand (Requirements: 3)
-   [ ] Add worker loader that conditionally imports Orama worker and falls back on failure (Requirements: 4)
-   [ ] Ensure existing search index state migrates cleanly and cached results persist across panel reopens (Requirements: 3, 4)
-   [ ] Update documentation shell to trigger lazy load only when user interacts (Requirements: 3)

## 5. Lazy Export/Import Toolchains

-   [ ] Refactor export/import click handlers to call shared lazy loaders for `streamsaver`, `dexie-export-import`, and `turndown` (Requirements: 5)
-   [ ] Add loading affordance if dependency resolution exceeds 150 ms and implement fallback paths (Requirements: 5)
-   [ ] Write integration tests covering export/import flows with mocked dynamic imports (Requirements: 5)

## 6. Telemetry & Performance Validation

-   [ ] Emit `lazy-boundary:loaded` events with timing data in each boundary success/failure path (Requirements: 6)
-   [ ] Capture analyzer snapshots pre/post change and document bundle size delta ≥20% (Requirements: 6)
-   [ ] Configure monitoring/alerts for lazy failure rate and document remediation steps (Requirements: 6)

## 7. QA & Regression Safety

-   [ ] Update component/E2E test suites to cover lazy boundaries for editor, search, and backup flows (Requirements: 1, 3, 5)
-   [ ] Run manual regression plan ensuring autosave, search indexing, and backup operations remain functional (Requirements: 1, 3, 5)
