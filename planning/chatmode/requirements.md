# LLM Tools Registry Requirements

## Introduction

The LLM Tools Registry empowers Or3 Chat plugin developers to expose lightweight, metadata-rich tool definitions that large language models can call during conversations. The solution must offer a simple registration API, runtime enable/disable controls, and seamless integration with the existing streaming chat workflow while staying minimal, composable, and extensible.

## Functional Requirements

1. **As a plugin developer, I want to register a tool with metadata and a handler so that the LLM can call my custom functionality.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN a plugin invokes `registerTool` with a unique tool name THEN the registry SHALL store the tool definition and handler and make it available to chat sessions.
        - WHEN a plugin unregisters a tool by name THEN the registry SHALL remove that tool and its handler from the active catalog.
2. **As a plugin developer, I want to provide optional metadata like icons and default enabled state so that the UI can reflect my tool appropriately.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN a tool is registered with optional metadata (icon URL, category, defaultEnabled) THEN the registry SHALL persist those fields alongside the definition.
        - WHEN metadata is omitted THEN the registry SHALL fall back to sensible defaults without throwing errors.
3. **As a chat participant, I want to toggle tools on or off per chat session so that I control what the LLM may execute.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN the user opens the ChatInput settings popover THEN the UI SHALL list all registered tools with labeled switches reflecting their enabled state.
        - WHEN the user toggles a tool off THEN subsequent chat requests SHALL omit that tool from the model tool list until it is re-enabled.
4. **As an LLM orchestrator, I want enabled tool definitions included in API calls so that the model knows what functions it can request.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN `useChat.sendMessage` builds the OpenRouter request THEN it SHALL pass only enabled tool definitions to `openRouterStream`.
        - WHEN no tools are enabled THEN the request SHALL omit the `tools` and `tool_choice` fields.
5. **As the chat engine, I want to execute tool calls during streaming so that the conversation seamlessly incorporates tool results.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN the stream yields a `tool_call` event THEN the engine SHALL pause text streaming, parse arguments, execute the matching handler, and append a `tool` role message with the handler result mapped to the provided `tool_call_id`.
        - WHEN the tool handler resolves successfully THEN the engine SHALL resume the model loop with the new history so the assistant can finalize its response.
6. **As a system maintainer, I want tool errors handled gracefully so that failures do not break the chat.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN a handler throws or returns a non-string value THEN the engine SHALL catch the error, log it, and push a `tool` message containing an error summary while allowing the assistant to continue.
        - WHEN the LLM requests an unknown tool name THEN the engine SHALL emit a diagnostic warning and respond with a `tool` message noting the missing tool.
7. **As a user, I want my tool toggle preferences remembered so that my settings persist across sessions.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN a toolâ€™s enabled state changes THEN the application SHALL persist the preference (e.g., in localStorage) keyed by tool name.
        - WHEN the chat UI loads THEN the registry SHALL hydrate enabled states from persisted preferences before the next send attempt.

## Non-Functional Requirements

8. **As a platform engineer, I want the registry to remain lightweight so that it adds minimal runtime overhead.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN the app initializes THEN the registry SHALL initialize in constant time with no network calls and avoid introducing new global singletons beyond a simple reactive store.
9. **As a security reviewer, I want argument validation so that malicious tool calls cannot trigger unsafe operations.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN handler arguments are parsed THEN the engine SHALL validate the payload against the registered parameter schema and reject malformed input with an error message.
10. **As a QA engineer, I want deterministic testing interfaces so that tools can be unit-tested.**
    - Acceptance Criteria
        - WHEN the registry is imported in tests THEN it SHALL expose pure registration APIs and an inspection method (`listTools`) that allows assertions without touching UI components.
