# Code Review Assignment Split

The original review has been split into two focused playbooks so each intern can work independently without stepping on the same files.

- [Intern A Playbook – Sidebar Core Hardening](./code-review-intern-a.md)
- [Intern B Playbook – Cleanup & Tooling](./code-review-intern-b.md)

Please read only the playbook assigned to you. If a task requires touching files outside your scope, flag it before making changes. The old findings, code samples, and acceptance criteria are all embedded in the respective playbooks.
