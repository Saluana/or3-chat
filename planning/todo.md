Killing the sidebar height math gives the biggest win. In app/components/sidebar/SideBar.vue (lines 520-636) we maintain a bespoke recomputeListHeight, attach a global ResizeObserver, and juggle listHeight through SideNavContent.vue, SidebarHomePage.vue, and SidebarVirtualList.vue (lines 1-27). If we let SidebarVirtualList size itself (either by flipping the inner container to pure flex/height: 100% or by letting the list run its own ResizeObserver), we can drop the window listeners, the listHeight ref/prop plumbing, and the extra watchers. The result is ~120 lines gone plus less layout thrash.
